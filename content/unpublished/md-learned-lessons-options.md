# MD Learned Lessons Options
- Don't take a contrarian call. Contrarian calls are often wrong. 
	- For Example If market is bullish, take either
		- Super Bullish Position ( Risky )
		- Neutral Bullish Position ( Less Profit )
		- Neutral Position ( Low Profit )
- ☠️ **Don't Close** profitable trade first & let the loss making trades naked. Refer -> [[22-04-21 5000 LOSS BIG MISTAKE|5000 LOSS BIG MISTAKE]]
- Made the same above mistake again. 😔. So, read it two times.
- Never take YouTube recommended stocks [[22-04-28 Expiry Date Debacle|Expiry date Debacle]]
- Do market orders only, avoid limit order ( cannot predict market )
- Its not worth being anxious, worst thing is to see the loss increasing.
- Sell off and conclude the trade even if it is profit or loss. There are better things to do.
- Don't need to wait till expiry day ->  [[22-04-28 Expiry Date Debacle|Expiry date Debacle]] .
- I learned its good to sell before expiry.
