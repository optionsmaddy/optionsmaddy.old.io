- EVERYDAY Account has to authorised via CDSL with TPIN so that all the orders including GTT could be processed. I sent an email to Zerodha regarding this. Authorisation should be done before order triggers. 
- As an alternative, I can give power of attorney to Zerodha ( Form must be downloaded filled & physically sent to Zerodha ) so that they can sell it without generating TPIN.
- Similarly, if I want to revoke, there is POA cancellation form, that also should be physically sent to Zerodha.
- Zerodha doesn't notify if the funds are not enough. It just cancels the order.
- Sensei Bull ₹800/- per Month.

### IMPORTANT Zerodha took ₹ 59/- for Call & Trade

## I never called Zerodha to place an order, why am I still charged call and trade charges?

Call and trade charges are applicable in two scenarios.

1. If you call Zerodha's dealer desk and place an order, you will be charged Rs 50 + 18% GST.

**Note**: This charge is per order placed (successfully placed buy/sell orders, executed orders, rejected orders, cancelled orders)

2. If you place an MIS order or Cover order (CO) and **do not close the position by 3.20 PM for Equity and 3.25 PM for F&O, 4.45 PM for CDS and 25 mins before market close for MCX**, it will be squared off by our RMS team and you will be charged **Rs 50 + 18% GST** - apart from the brokerage for the trade, just like a call and trade.

### For example

You call our dealing desk to place an intraday buy order. The order gets executed, and you place a limit sell order to close the positions. However, there were no bids for your offer price, so your order doesn't get executed and is still pending. At 3:18 PM our RMS team will cancel your pending order and square off your position. You will be charged Rs 50 + 18% GST.
