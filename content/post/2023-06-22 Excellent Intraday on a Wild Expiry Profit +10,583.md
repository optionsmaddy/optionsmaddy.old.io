# Intraday +3,038 & Weekly Ladder +3,617 Realized ðŸ™‚

- Today was a wild expiry. 
- For many traders  this was one of the worst expiry with wild swings.
- I could see many negative PnL on twitter.
- I closed my weekly ladder by the evening & added monthly position.
- Also did BN Intraday.
- Couldn't capture entire movement.
- Today was a great day for scalping.
- Money could have minted in scalping with wild swings.
- Also I was able to close the ladder profitably.
- Day's history shows +5K, +2K by exiting in the right time.
