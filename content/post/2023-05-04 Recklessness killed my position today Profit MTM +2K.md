# Recklessness ( No SL ) killed my profit today

![](https://i.imgur.com/HVzElCA.png)

- I was experimenting a strangle.
- Max profit was â‚¹450/-
- Now, I was busy today so I went outside, by the time I came back I was in â‚¹ -2000/- Loss ðŸ¤¬.
- A massive spike has shifted my â‚¹ 6 call to â‚¹ 60, sounds unbeleivable right.

- The large green spike killed my position.
- **I had no SL**
- Took 4X loss.
- Eventhought loss is not much ( -â‚¹2k ) & it was eperimental position.
- My recklessness was the reason I lost it.
- I feel indebted today as I got a slap from the market. Net time when I have big position I will never be this reckless again.

NB:  Also I couldn't close my CE position. SO God knows how much penalty I would have to pay for that. I had a limit order which never went off and by the time i edit it market closed. ðŸ˜ž
