# No amount in green is small. Closed weekly positions, took new weekly strangle

- Decay will give more loss i held overnight. ( Because o debit spread)
- Market has also allen too much.
- One order didn't execute properly & didn't get opportunity to take it.
- Vix is very low.
- Hence I chose to close my Call Condor + Put Ratio Positions.
- Took a simple Nakeed Strangle ( with slightly bllish bias ).
- I never take naked strangles but this time as premiums were very low I took it.
- 100 to 150 pts safety on opening.
- Big gap down or up & will get wrecked. 🤞🏼
