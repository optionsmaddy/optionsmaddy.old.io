# Stressful Day. Trapped. Intraday Loss 1.1K

- -837 Loss. Very Stressful Intraday. Trapped. Multiple Contra positions went wrong.
- Was holding a lossmaking position entire day.
- Somehow escaped it with just -â‚¹200 Loss.
- Then took another short position only 1 Lot.
- It gave -â‚¹800 Loss.
- No big loss but very stressful, unproductive day. ðŸ˜–

- Sold one naked position in profit.
- Thought it was very high to buy the loss making position, hence bought hedge for the naked position.
