# Intraday straddle & Intraday buy went wrong on Big Money games

- Today I tried straddle again like yesterdays strangle.
- Went wrong horribly.
- Position sizing saved big loss
- Lost around -1K.
- After 3 O clock expected horrible upmove like  yesterday.
- Took position intraday pe, thankfully one strike down.
- A massive downmove killed position.
- Averaged and got ample opportunity to reduce or close position in profit.
- But I gambled & lost another -1K.
- Loss is small but the mental trauma is hard.

Lesson : Never gamble to recover loss. Sometime it had given big retuns but the right way is better. Slow & study positional is the right way to go.
