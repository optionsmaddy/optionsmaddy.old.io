# GAP Down as expected, Profits realized by closing positional took new strategy for the next weeks trade

- Market gap down as FOMC meeting tonight, 25bps expected, US market corrected to that.üîª
- Took a disastorous intraday trade in the morning. I was at ‚Çπ -3,500/- Loss but then took additional position one strike up & recovered loss + made ‚Çπ +2,000/- Profit. ‚ò∫Ô∏è 
- By noon markets were extremely volatile.
- At noon I was able to exit my position at minimal loss & took new positions.
- Skipped this week at breakeven.


## Took a new Put Ratio + Call Condor Strategy.

- This is a strategy I wanted to try for long time.
- Last weeks Strangle backfired I am motivated to try this strategy.

### Initial Setup

- First Installment
- Will add more after FOMC meeting.

#### Features
- Good profit if market goes up.
- Escape route if market goes down.
- Long range.
- Good RR.
- Less POP, but POP increases as market goes up.
- If market goes down then can escape near 17800 & then do strangle.
- Small loss if market goes nowhere.
- FOMC meeting & many stock results to come, markets should move either way.

## Overall a very good day no complaints.

- Realized Profit ‚Çπ 5945/-
- Positional MTM ‚Çπ902/-
- Skipped this expiry positional, may do intraday.
- Took new positions for 11th May.
