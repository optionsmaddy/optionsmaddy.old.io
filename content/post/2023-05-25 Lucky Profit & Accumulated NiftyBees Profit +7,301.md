# Closed Expiry Day Positions Yesterday

### Lucky Profit

- Put a far down limit order & forget about it.
- Power went off when I came back It had hit & was in profit.
- Immediately took profit.
- These low vix expiries I am avoiding as it can go anywhere.
- Also Indian markets are getting uncorrelated with the US markets.

### Accumulated NiftyBees ETF

- Hadn't done this months SIP.
- I bought Nifty Index ETF today.
- I believe in current market index funds are better than MFs.
- Midcaps are up.
- I got Niftybees under 200.
- On long run it will yield profit.
- I can also pledge it.

### Holding June 8th Positions

- Holding wide strangle, which will be converted to Iron condor when it breaches the critical mark.
- Skipped June 1st Expiry because Cannot predict Month beginning movement.
- I hope the decay will give more opportunity in the first week of June to close the position & take new ones.
