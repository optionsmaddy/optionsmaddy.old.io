# Positions

- Tried mock trade of one of the stockrsi + vwap + pivot strategy from YT.
- Didn't worked out.
- My strategy works better for now.

# Day's History

## Plan

- Close June position by tomorrow evening if opportunity arises.
- Otherwise close of Wednesday end.
- Position is safe but not out of danger.
- A 1% down move could give good loss. ( -10K )
- But trend is upside.
