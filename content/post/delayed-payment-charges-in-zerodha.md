## What does "Delayed payment charges" entry on the funds statement mean?

Delayed payment charges are levied for the following reasons:

1.  **A negative balance in the Zerodha account:** If the utilised funds crosses the available balance in the Zerodha account, it will lead to a debit balance. Additionally, if charges are debited without sufficient balance, it could result in a debit balance. In such instances, interest at 0.05% per day or 18% per annum will be levied on the debit balance.
2.  **Over-utilisation of non-cash equivalent collateral margin:** Exchanges stipulate that for overnight F&O positions, 50% of the margin needs to compulsorily come in cash or cash equivalent collateral, and the remaining 50% can be in terms of non-cash collateral margin. If sufficient cash margin is not maintained and the shortfall is funded by the non-cash collateral, there will be a delayed payment charge of 0.035% per day or 12.5% per annum on the shortfall in the cash margin requirement.

To avoid _Delayed Payment Charges,_ maintain sufficient funds in the Zerodha account.
