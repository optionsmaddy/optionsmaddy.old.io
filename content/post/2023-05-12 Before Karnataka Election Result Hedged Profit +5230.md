# Call IVs Stalled, Put IV Spiked before Karnataka elections result

- People may be taking Long Vega strategies.
- Hence big volatility in the morning.
- Small spike in Vix.
- Expecting markets to go up, but have good proteection downwards.
- Infact I am safer far down than far up.
- Also added a strangle.
