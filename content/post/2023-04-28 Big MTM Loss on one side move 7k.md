# Post Market

- Intraday small trade was saved because I had put limit order.
- I closed intraday position at right time and manged to save around potential loss of â‚¹ 3000/-
- But then I waned to push ce position then rejected that idea. 
- I will close position on tuesday.
- If it opens in the current level the decay will give profitable exit.
- If it gets a gapdown then I will get a good profit.
- If it opens gap up then I will have to take some loss.
- Anyway lets see Tuesday on May 2nd.
