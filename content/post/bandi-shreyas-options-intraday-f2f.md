	- Check Intraday OI ( [OI vs Strike](https://www.optiontools.in/oianalysis) ) - Put OI Strong then people thing down side is limited.
	- Check Historical OI - Find point of maximum congestion
		-  point where there is Maximum PUT & CALL OI.
		- market has tendency to move towards this.
		- Check for the bar size. Who is first @ risk ?
3. Pricing of Risk
	- Add PE & CE price of the chosen strike price. eg: 17,000 strike & ‚Çπ250 sum of CE & PE.
	- Add & Subtract ‚Çπ250 from 17,000. 16750-17250. This is range @ which it is trading.
	- Current price should be below "Avg Price" to Short (Sell).

-  Make sure what you are selling is at least 1 Strike away from the range. ie Minimum 16700-17300.
- Aim to be in a position that today itself make money.
- Best time of the entry is Morning, after three 5 minutes candle. (15 Minutes)
- Check ( Ideal if the same price for both CE & PE, points may be away differently )
- Strangle is a bullish to sideway strategy. So equidistant make money if market goes up.
- People are afraid on put side.
- I don't trade on Monday. Because...
	- Monday don't get much decay. 
	- US markets have not opened yet.
	- Monday keep small target.
- If the call didn't work. Take the loss & Close that call and follow the price, shortening the width towards put.
- Roll Down.
- Keep premium equal ( almost). 
- Since not close to expiry keep more distance..
- Bring the winning leg closer.
- Push the losing leg farther.
- In current IV, 
	- On Thursday closing next expiry, or Friday Opening ATM CE+PE = 270 to 280.
	- On Monday : 250-260
	- on Tuesday : 200-220
	- on Wednesday : 170-180
	- on Thursday closing: 140-100
- If it doesn't make money, Run away.
- Strict Stop loss.
- Wednesday & Thursday make good amount of money, as it is going to zero people sell off.
- Shreyas Buys Stocks & sell CE options.
