## Market could correct tomorrow

- tomorrow night FOMC meting is there. 
- I tried to push 18100 CE to 18200 CE but decided to close this weeks position at around -7k loss if I get opportunity.
- Currently hopeful but the situation is tense as there is massive one side move.
- The momentum should push it up, but rational says it has to correct tomorrow.

- Bought Full hedge on the upside 18300 CE.
