- At 13:10 pm Operator dumped Finnifty.
- Finnifty fell 160pts.

- I was in +â‚¹ 800 profit / stangle before 13:10pm. 
- At 13:45pm I was -â‚¹ 2400 loss / stangle.
- I closed the CE first.
- I placed a bull put spread 1 strike above.
- Also ought hedge 2 strikes above.
- In right opportunity I closed my 18800 PE & added 18750 PE.
- **The idea was to shift my unhedged position into 2x safer hedged position, so that even if market move either way I will be protected.**
- When market corrected fromm -â‚¹2500 loss I exited at â‚¹78 profit.
- I was able to manage my position despite market manipulation in the expiry.
- This was mainy die to "*Low Position Sizing".
