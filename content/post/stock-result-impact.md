# Stock Result Impact
If a stock has fallen significantly, just ahead of results, there must be some short covering. 

If a stock has gone up significantly, just ahead of results, there must be some long unwinding.  

But in both HDFC Bank & Infosys, this did not happen.  
Are there any insider information?
