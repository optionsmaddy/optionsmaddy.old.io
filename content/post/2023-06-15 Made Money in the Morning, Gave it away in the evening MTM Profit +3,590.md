# Breakeven Day. Gave the market 2K again intraday trade went wrong

## Carried Position Gone Right

### Lesson : Always put reliable targets for intraday

- If you refer [Yesterday](https://optionsmaddy.github.io/post/2023-06-14-closed-positions-profit-realized-+16497/) .
- Yesterday I bought 200qts - 18750 PE for **â‚¹36.10**, today I sold it for **â‚¹45.45**. 
- I had put order to trigger at 49. But when I checked CPR, CPR was on **â‚¹45.60**.
- Hence, I shifted my buy target to **â‚¹45.45** which resulted in a near perfect execution.ðŸ™‚
- Immediately after executing order it slumped towards **â‚¹23**.
- A potential 4.5K Loss was evaded.
