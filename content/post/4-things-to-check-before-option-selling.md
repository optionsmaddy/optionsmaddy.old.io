# 4 Things to Check before Option Selling
1. Check **Margin** required. Check profit w.r.t bank interest rate profit to see weather it is profitable or not.
2. **IV** very important. Check out **Average IV trend chart**. While SELLING options IV should DROP not rise. Chance of loss even when call goes right. IV works like elastic. Cyclic. Both rise & fall.
- How to Check IV ?
	- 1 Month before what was IV, What was Max IV last month. Check IV now. If IV is declining then one can sell. eg: (Last Month High + Last Month Low)/2 > Current IV then buy.
- Avoid stock selling & buying, trade index. 
3. **Check Trend**. When to buy & sell option ?
	- If you are sure of trend, either buy future or buy call ( if up ) buy put ( if down).
	- If you think market RANGE BOUND or wont go up/down RAPIDLY then SELL PUT.
	- Avoid selling options during volatility.
4. **Expiry**.
	- Don't sell options farther than 5 to 7 days expiry.
