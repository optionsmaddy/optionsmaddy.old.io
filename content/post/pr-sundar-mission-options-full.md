## 10. Intrinsic Value & Time Value Explained⌛
- Time Value : In time there is favourable change in the price.
![](https://i.imgur.com/hUZBYjk.png)
- Time Value maximum **At the money**.
- In India, we are using European options. ( Cannot be exercised in between )
- When the option expires in the end of the month, If forget to close exchange will close, then one will only get intrinsic value, No time value. 
## 11. Buying Stocks vs Futures vs Options🥊
- **OPTION** If we are BUYING Call option Example :
	- If One Nifty 13500 pts Call option is ₹76.50, Nifty lot size = 75, You Pay 75 * 76.5 = ₹ 5738/-
	- If market moves More that 13,500 pts you gain.
	- Max loss ₹ 5738/-
	- If Nifty goes 14000 Pts then 500 * 75 = ₹37,500/- Profit
	- Paid only ₹6K, Profit ₹38K 
	- Can also sell anytime.
	- Limited Loss, More Profit, Catch : Expiry Date
- **CASH Market** ( Stock Delivery)
	- SBI share = ₹ 245/-
	- Want to buy 3000 stocks, 3000 * ₹ 245 = ₹ 7 Lakh 35 Thousand Only
	- Pay in Cash = ₹ 7,35,000/-
	- 💰Tax : ₹ 1,685/-
- **Futures Market**
	- Pay Margin Money = ₹ 2,33,000/-
	- 💰Tax  : ₹ 175/-
- **Option Chain**
	- Pay Premium = ₹ 1,38,000/-
	- 💰Tax : ₹ 330/-
![](https://i.imgur.com/Iq8g1A1l.png)
 * ==Option Same profit but when stock falls high then less loss  than futures & cash market.== 
 * **So if bullish, buy IN THE MONEY call option.**
 * **if bearish, buy IN THE MONEY put option.**
## 12. Options Selling Explained🪝 
- #🧔PRSundar is a Option seller.
- Option seller has more probability of profit.
- See Pay Off Chart from **[OPSTRA Options Strategy Builder](https://opstra.definedge.com/strategy-builder)** 
## 13. Options Buying vs Selling🤼

![](https://i.imgur.com/FzCohIs.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/7F9XNPI.png)
- Seller need to give significantly large money as collateral than what buyer pays.
- ==Biggest Advantage of Option seller is that Option seller can give money as collateral.==

![](https://i.imgur.com/2BkQXxV.png)

## 14. What is Collateral in Options Trading🏦
- Can check NSE Website for seeing the haircut for the collateral instruments.
## 15. How Margins Work in Options📇
- In case of Futures both buyer & seller either gains or loses money. ( M2M profit/Loss)
![](https://i.imgur.com/GQuIvfa.png)

- In Options Buyer already paid money so there is no M2M transactions later.

![](https://i.imgur.com/4BumyKJ.png)

## 16. Exercise & Assignment in Options🏋🏼 
- In India we use European Style.
	- PE - Put Option European Style
	- CE - Call Option European Style
- Last Thursday of every month is Expiry.
- Exercised Option will happen only on the intrinsic value
![](https://i.imgur.com/HnHopvY.png)

## 17. Expiry & Physical Settlement Explained📅
- Indices has weekly options.
- **Every Thursday Weekly Expiry**
-  Total 10 Weeks.
- Total 3 Months.
- Also Quarterly Expiry.
- Half Yearly Expiry.
![](https://i.imgur.com/YtpMjtR.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/OqyeXJn.png)
- Stocks only Monthly ( 3 Choices ) Expiries.
- going closer to expiry even for the buyer exchange keep increasing the margin money.
- **==Always trade in INDEX Options.==** - #🧔PRSundar 
- Because margin keeps increasing as one would have to taker the physical delivery of the stocks.

## 18. Option Greeks 1 DELTA 📏

![](https://i.imgur.com/GoMrELI.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/x9ZFQyK.png)


![](https://i.imgur.com/MyzOEZd.png)

## 19. Option Greeks 2 GAMMA 🏎️
- Bad/Good news triggers Gamma.
- Closer to the expiry GAMMA effect will be more.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ENksGMO.png)

**==Many professional sellers don't take it till the expiry.==**
- Delta is like Velocity.
- Gamma is like Acceleration.

![](https://i.imgur.com/R1PjjI8.png)
## 20. Option Greeks 3 VEGA 📰
- Vega : Volatility Index.
- Volatile : Not moving in single direction.
- Stable Government : Positive News : Buy Call option premium increase.
- VIX : Volatility Index.
- Global/Local Incidents increases VIX
![](https://i.imgur.com/URzaCU8.png)
 
![](https://i.imgur.com/fVsPha3.png)

- GOTO [India VIX Data](https://in.investing.com/indices/india-vix-chart) , Check the Strike Rate & LTP, Find percentage using [Percentage Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/percent-calculator.html) .
- If India Vix ⬆️ then Premium ⬆️
- If India Vix ⬇️ then Premium ⬇️
- **Option buyer** buys when **Vix is Low**, Premium goes up.
- **Option seller** sells when **Vix is High**, Premium goes down.

![](https://i.imgur.com/i0rWHEC.png)
- IMPORTANT : *We don't know how LOW is LOW & how HIGH is HIGH. Its relative.* Vix also goes up & down.

## 21. Option Greeks 4 THETA ⌚ &  RHO🪙
### Theta ⌚

![](https://i.imgur.com/JN0xlMO.png)
- There is both "Point decay" & "time decay".

![](https://i.imgur.com/hxSUMVA.png)

- For OUT OF THE MONEY options, as there is no intrinsic value only extrinsic value, as the day passes the buyer keep losing money if delta gamma Vega etc remains the same.
- If the expiry is 2 Days then 50% of the time value has gone.
![](https://i.imgur.com/VI1ouka.png)

- Don't buy closer to expiry, as time decay is more.

![](https://i.imgur.com/rIbBR5t.png)

- Time value always decrease for buyer. Never works on favour of the buyer.
- Seller will have an effect of gamma & delta but theta is a sellers best friend 💘.
### Rho 💰

- Effect of price due to change in the interest rate.
- When interest increases in Bank FDs, then option business will be low.
- Risk free business over Risky business.

![](https://i.imgur.com/3brAKwV.png)

- As interest rate does not fluctuate much, we could ignore the RHO.
## 22. Implied Volatility (IV), IV Rank, IV Percentile Explained📉
![](https://i.imgur.com/SbNrHYx.png)
### Implied Volatility (IV)
- Observation : Put Option more than Call IV. ( Reason : Things can go bad tomorrow than things good things happening.)
- Far out of the money options have higher IV, hence lower premium.
- IV high -> Market move higher
- IV low -> Market move lower
![](https://i.imgur.com/XuWnP6k.png)

### IV Rank
![](https://i.imgur.com/LmtWgjy.png)
### IV Percentile
- Problem with IV
![](https://i.imgur.com/pXgdpt3m.png)
- Only one day it was trading for 550, but still it averages it. Hence we use IV percentile.
- IV Percentile (IVPQ) : What % of days it was lower than todays IV. 
- Historical IV is used.

## 23. VOLUME & OPEN INTEREST in Options🔊
- Everyday contracts are being traded.
- Long built up -  People buying contracts
- Short built up - People selling contracts
- Short covering - covering up losing position when market goes up.
- Long unwinding - covering up losing position when market goes down.
