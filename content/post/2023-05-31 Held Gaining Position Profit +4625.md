# Good market Down Day
## Intraday Profit + Missed Opportunity to close position

- Initially I had decided to close position today & take new straddle with partial hedging pivoted around 18500.
- Current position is pivoted around 18300.
- Opening was good & market went down well which is an excellent outcome for me.
- From losing position of -6000 Started the day with profit around +3000.
- Then market moved down to give +4800 at one point of time.
- I had some errant to run, by the time i returned market had gone up slightly from 18500 to 18550.
- Closed with +3620 MTM Profit

### Intraday Bank Nifty +1037 Profit

- Intraday profit in BN +1,037. 
- I bought it at 237 & averaged on 225. It went up to 454 ðŸ¤¯.
- I sold it at 251.8 at profit +1,037 ðŸ™‚.
- If I held it profit would have been +10,000. ðŸ˜”

### Expectation

- Tomorrow hopefully no gap up.
- I want to close position at right time & take new position for either 8th or 15th June pivoted on 18500.
- Worst case is if it goes back to 18650.
