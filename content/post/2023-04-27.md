## Zerodha Issue Incident
- Zerodha had issue today. 
- I was able to place order but cannot cancel order.
- People were complaining on twitter.
- I recorded the video on phone, if the problem escalated I could produce evidence for reimbursement.
- Finaly, withing a few minutes all orders were cancelled siting "lapsed by mid day reconciliation sinker" error in zerodha.
- Thankfully Zerodha started working.
