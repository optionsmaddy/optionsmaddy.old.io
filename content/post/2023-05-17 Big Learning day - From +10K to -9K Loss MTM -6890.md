### The Happening

- Took a trade in the morning, closed with +500 Profit.
- Then bought 18200 CE.
- **Averaged aggrasively.**
- Had 250 qts.
- Didn't had SL as SL was hunted beore.
- Rapid fall & markeet never recovered.
- Realized loss -9500 🥹
- Took 300 qts position below 18150.
- I had recovered before like this.
- But then the fall didn't stop.
- I closed new position at +500 Profit.
- Total Loss = -9000.
- 7000 more than anticipated intraday loss.
- This wiped off my positional profit.

### Learning

- **Position conversion not allowed in buying in Zerodha.**
- Hence if market does not recover then cannot carry position, have to take new positions.
- AVOID Intraday trades near expiry.
- Don't average aggrasively, average at wide distance.
- Also roll position towards market movement. ✅
- Use market order to do intraday trades or limit over the resistences.
- Putting order under resistence is dangerous.
- Discipine = Exit at daily perited loss.
- Market might not recover or that day if possible place only NRML position.
- Keep SL. ( Eventhough it would be hunted. )

**Overall Bad Trade day 🤬, Good Learning day 👨🏼‍🎓**
